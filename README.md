# Article Sediment  

This project contains front-end software and a backend server. The front-end displays the sediment of an article. The backend serves the front-end website and gets the sediment of an article using a Natural Language Processing API. 

## Backend Server

Backend Server uses Node's Express module to communicate to the front-end and to retrieve an article's sentiment from an API service. 

## Front-end Website

The front-end website allows a website address of an article to be entered and submitted to the backend. The backend retrieves the results of the article's NLP and returns it to the Front-end.
